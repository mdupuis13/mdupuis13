ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m @mdupuis13
I'm from Quebec, Canada and my mother tongue is French (well, the French Canadian version of French anyways !)

ðŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in software development (I currently create java APIs for a big Credit Union). I also ride a road bike in the summer and take care of my familly.

Iâ€™m currently learning nvim, bash scripting, SpringBoot and github actions mostly.
